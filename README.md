## The problem IntelliForm solves

Collecting data from people is essential for different purposes. It can be for event registration, feedback forms, opinion surveys. But filling up our valuable personal data and opinion comes with a lot of risk. Data is gold. The data we enter into a google form is not guaranteed to be safe. By doing so we are compromising our privacy. The opinion we fill up in a survey is not safe from manipulation. The central entity storing the data may use it for its own interests. It can be for advertising, social profiling. We are not the owner of our data.

We need a decentralized system to collect people data and store it in a secure immutable way. The ownership of the data should belong to the ones really own it. Not the owners of the application or the owners of the servers. Because, your data is not somebodyâ€™s business. We need a form creator which store our data in decentralized manner. We need a system to validate users based on their ownership of asset, like a NFT.

## Challenges we ran into

Integration of Polygon blockchain, WeaveDB, IPFS are a major challenge.
Implementation of NFT validation was challenging. We deployed contracts and minted our own NFT.


## Implementation

We have developed an AI-driven system for creating registration forms that simplifies the process by generating forms based on prompts. Additionally, users have the flexibility to customize forms or create them entirely from scratch. These forms can seamlessly integrate payment acceptance for registrants, and form creators can employ NFT validation to ensure that users possess NFTs from a specific collection. To enhance security, user data is encrypted and stored on the blockchain, specifically on the Polygon blockchain, to facilitate NFT and payment verification. The frontend of this system is deployed on Replit.
